#Description:
This GitHub repository hosts the Sales and Profit Analysis project, which delves into the sales and profit data of a fictional company across various regions, products, and segments. The project encompasses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and insights generation to understand key factors affecting sales and profitability.

Data Cleaning Process:
Conversion of relevant columns to their appropriate data types, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.

Handling Null Values:
Identification and strategic handling of null or missing values. Null values were either filled in using appropriate strategies or removed from the dataset.

Column Name Renaming:
Renaming of columns for clarity and standardization, ensuring uniformity in column naming conventions.

Column Removal:
Certain columns, including "Month Number," "Month Name," and "Year," were removed from the dataset to streamline it for analysis. The rationale for column removal is documented in the analysis.

Analysis:
The analysis phase of the project includes the following key insights and actions:

- Identification of the most profitable product and the product with the highest sales.
- Determination of the countries with the highest total sales and profits.
- Exploration of segment distribution through a pie chart.
- Bar plot visualization of units sold by segment.
- Visualization of total sales and total profits by country through bar plots.
- Time series analysis of the trend in total profits over time.
- Scatter plot with a regression line to illustrate the correlation between "Units Sold" and "Gross Sales."
- A heatmap to visualize correlations between numerical variables.
